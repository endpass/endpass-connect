# Development

## Local process

If you want to make awesome feature to `endpass-connect` you should fork and
clone one of application which uses connect. For example [connect-demo](https://github.com/endpass/connect-demo).

Then, you should link `endpass-connect` repository to cloned application. See example with `yarn` below:

```bash
cd /path/to/endpass-connect
yarn link

cd /path/to/connect-demo
yarn link @endpass/connect
yarn
```

So, now you should runs `dev` script in the connect and `dev` in the application.

All done, you can do all what you want! ðŸ™Œ
